# React PhotoLabs

Welcome to the PhotoLabs project for the Web Development React course programming. This project is a combination of a frontend and backend server, both of which need to be set up and run separately.

It aims to display images that users upload, allowing the images to be categorized for easier sorting/viewing, and liked.

## Setup

To get started, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies in both the `/frontend` and `/backend` directories. You can do this by navigating to each directory in your terminal and running the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

## Important Notice

⚠️ **WARNING:** Make sure you have your backend running before you try to render things on the frontend. If your backend is not running, your frontend will display an empty page! ⚠️

If you have ran your frontend before your backend, just hard refresh (F5) the page once the backend is running.

## [Backend] Running Backend Servier

For the backend server, you'll first need to read the `backend/readme` for further setup details. Once you've done that, you can start the server by navigating to the `/backend` directory in your terminal and running the following command:

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

## [Frontend] Running Webpack Development Server

To start the frontend server, navigate to the `/frontend` directory in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```
